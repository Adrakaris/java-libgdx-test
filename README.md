# Java LibGDX Test

I'm wanting something simple that I can use like pygame (but in a statically typed language)
and LibGDX has so far fit that pretty well.

This is just a kind of test repo of small things, currently there's only a game with a 
bouncing ball that you can drag and drop. I do however plan to add my colour slider
thingy into this too.
